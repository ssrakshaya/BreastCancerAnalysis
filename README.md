# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Analysis

This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and classification modeling using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
It compares the performance of different machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), to predict tumor classifications.
